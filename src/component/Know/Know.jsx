        The products that are coming out are mostly after training duration. The community has also started 
with some Designs, Yoga Mats and Laundry Basket to be constructed out of the Rugs. Small Pouches
and Bags, already been exhibited in major cities. Thus, has slowly started with the Cut Shuttle Technique, as it is a vigorous skill to understand for a weaver. Hence, it would take some more time to
perfect in a complex diversified Designs.
The Artisans made a lot of mistake, and had to redo the weaving many times. It was a challenge, but 
somehow we managed to get the collection done. The Basketry collection was an easier thing to do, 
as the project was ongoing already with the order's.
And as per the situation, the Master weaver has been working hard to help these Artisans learn the 
skill at the earliest. And perfect it as the time goes by. As of, there is a planning of introducing the 
Products to Online firm and also Exhibit it in Foreign if possible. And looking on to the recent order's, would soon start with bigger amount of order's. 
It has been immense joy on helping these Artisans with a more sustained Livelihood and the outcome has been a great success. It has always given a Satisfaction for our soul. Hence, would keep 
working, till these Artisans become an Entrepreneur on their own.

        This training became the need after the survey of the village. 
During the survey, we went to every house of the village to know
the Social constraints and the Taboo they are living in. This resulted in knowing more about the pain and freedom of the married women, who cannot come out for work and explore in their 
Indigenous Crafts. 
This resulted in a project being offered to give them training on 
Rugs making and mobilize them about the benefits of the skill 
which would stay with them all their living year’s.

        It has literally helped them, understanding the Importance of Craft. The Income 
generated after the training has been the major change . This can be also called as 
a Freedom Money for the Artisans. And because of this, now the village people are 
more aware of the possibilities. And does not try to hold the women’s by a social 
Barrier.
